CHANGELOG
===================================


- issue9: Feature Request: 
    Configuration Settings now have a Permission Viewer section! 
    The option, if checked, will prompt the GM the same dialog for Default: Limited share to player options.
    Unchecked, the entry is automatically only shown to the players.
