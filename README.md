# Permission Viewer
![Package Title](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FLeague-of-Foundry-Developers%2Fleague-repo-status%2Fshields-endpoint%2Fpermission_viewer.json)


This Foundry VTT module displays colored diamonds/squares/circles to represent the players who have limited/observer/owner permissions on Entities (Actors, Journal entries, Items, etc..).

It makes it very easy to see at a glance which journal, actor or item is shared with your players. The shapes are :

* Diamond : Limited permission
* Square : Observer permission
* Circle : Owner permission

The color of the dots represents the color of the player. In the case of permissions shared with `All Players`, the shape will have the Blue/Yellow/Green/Red colors.
